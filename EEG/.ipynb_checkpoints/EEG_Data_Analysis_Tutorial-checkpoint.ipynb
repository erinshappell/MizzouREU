    "First, let's talk about what an EEG wave is and what it can tell us.\n",
    "\n",
    "EEG stands for __electroencephalogram__, which is a test that records the electrical signals produced by the brain. Our brain cells communicate using electrical signals and we can measure some of these signals using special electrodes. A signal may be classified by its __frequency__ (number of impulses measured per second) and __amplitude__ (the strength of each impulse).\n",

    "So, now that we know what some of these waves look like, let's examine our own brain waves and see what we find! We probably won't see any __delta__ or __theta__ waves (unless you were very committed and _fell asleep_ while taking measurements) but if you closed your eyes and relaxed at any point, you may catch an __alpha__ wave somewhere in your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are several __code blocks__ filled with Python code. To examine our waves, we need to __run__ each of these blocks in order. To run a code block, select the block by _clicking the block once_ (you should see a green block appear around the cell) then _press [SHIFT] and [ENTER] at the same time_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first code block below will require you to change a line of code--be sure to follow the instructions so that you read the correct EEG data file!\n",
